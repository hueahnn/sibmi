Rundown of project with Kepler on the M2
- Plasmids with insertion sequences are cool in that they can combine and form fusion plasmids (dimers) and this is a way for antibiotic resistance genes and other mutations to spread. Essentially they form this one big plasmid.
- Can identify these plasmids because it will have 2 ORIs. Specifically IS ORI IS ORI
- Find plasmids with this pattern (2+ repeating) 


# Jun 11, 2025

Instructions from Kepler:
1. Set up cluster
   1. Get O2 account
   2. Install conda/mamba
   3. Install jupyterlab
2. Download the PlasmidScope database ‚Üí done by Arya, on o2
3. Homogeneously annotate the PlasmidScope database
   1. Use snakemake with bakta
   2. If this is too much only run it on circular complete plasmids

Getting set up with Arya:
- Most important: getting set up with o2
  - Note: o2 will be down 6/23-26‚Ä¶ use git to access code and work locally
  - github repo: https://github.com/hueahnn/sibmi 
  - Go through a git repo tutorial 
- Snakemake: essentially a directed acyclic graph. Use defines inputs that match to an output and a function maps each input to an output. This ‚Äúfunction‚Äù is user defined script
  - Documentation: https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/setup.html 
  - Example: https://github.com/karel-brinda/MiniPhy/ 
  - Read through snakemake documentation
- [PlasmidScope](https://plasmid.deepomics.org/download#gbk) Database
  - About: https://plasmid.deepomics.org/tutorial 
- bakta annotation software: https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta
  - bakta DB path on o2: /n/data1/hms/dbmi/baym/databases/bakta_dbv6/db
  - example usage: bakta --db /n/data1/hms/dbmi/baym/databases/bakta_dbv6/db ../../decompressed_genomes/allthebacteriav2/stdin.part_002/nisin-susceptibility-associated-two-component-system-response-regulator-NsaR_GCF_900635095.1_33763_A01_WP_000697886.1-len666/SAMN18961669.fa --output SAMN18961669_bakta --force --skip-plot
- More down the line, but familiarize with pandas if using python: https://pandas.pydata.org/ 

Tips + words of advice:
- Know why I‚Äôm doing what I‚Äôm doing and have a clear narrative and story behind my project for the end of the summer presentation
- For the snakemake pipeline I will be building, do it in batches and scale up ‚Üí good practice
- As a bioinformatician, it is easy to get lost in the sauce ü•´make sure to understand the biology behind what I‚Äôm doing and ask lots of questions!


# Jun 12, 2025

Action items for today: 
- Git clone and set up repo
- Make snakemake pipeline

Snakemake pipeline: goal ‚Äì to annotate all of the plasmids in the database using bakta

Familiarize with:
- Git version control and documentation
- Snakemake
- Clusters and shared compute systems

Tomorrow:
- Bakta trial
- Snakemake pipeline


# Jun 13, 2025

- Snakefile time ‚Üí can just use vim
- Example bakta run: 
`bakta --db /n/data1/hms/dbmi/baym/databases/bakta_dbv6/db ./PLSDB/fasta/PLSDB_OX335189.1.fasta --output ./bakta --force`
- Git set up
  - Use issues to document ‚Üí kind of like a to-do list/diary
  - Use branches to keep neat
    - Branches open: master, snakemake
    - git checkout -b <name>
- Requesting an interactive o2 job: 
`srun --pty -p interactive -t 12:00:00 --mem=16G bash`
- Extracting + unzipping files: 
`wget <url>`
`tar - xvzf <file>`


# Jun 16, 2025

- Snakefile works for one file ‚Üí now generalize for multiple files and scale up
  - Points of confusion: 
    - If calling on multiple files, how to do this because with one file I specify the name of the output file when I call snakemake in the command line
    - rule all structure: check each folder to see if all output files are present and if so output to a .txt file ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù
- Works for one file, generalized to 2 then 8
  - When running 8 got a memory error ‚Üí either increase the memory (>16G) or decrease the core (was running on 4, decreased to 2 which was much slower but ran through the end)
  - 8 complete ‚Üí but took a while, generalize to larger batches by having each call submit a new sbatch job
- Arya sent his code for submitting cluster jobs within a snakemake call

# Jun 17, 2025

- Implementing cluster job submission feature, to call:
`snakemake --use-conda --profile slurmprofile -p --keep-going --rerun-incomplete --executor slurm`
- O2 has been down :( sbatch still pending but see if the call works, next step is run with more files. To sample a random cluster of files from a directory: 
`ls <file directory> | shuf | head`

# Jun 20, 2025

- More on the background of the project and the so what:
  - Want to see the how prevalent heterodimerization due to insertion sequences are amongst all heterodimers
  - AMR genes historically were more prevalent on the chromosome but since the introduction of antibiotics have been moved to plasmids. 
- Breakdown of project in steps:
  1. Set up
  2. Annotations --> download all meta data and use pandas to filter through for only the complete and circular sequences.
  3. Find insertion sequences and ORIs
  4. Of the heterodimers, filter out ones with the specific topology of IS ORI IS ORI
- To do list for today: 
  - Get Snakefile to work for large datasets (having each bakta call submit a sbatch job to the cluster)
  - Set up pandas and Jupyter and filter through the metadata (and download the metadata onto the cluster)
    - Instead of using the OS package, use pandas to extract the names of the files
- Snakemake command: `snakemake --profile slurmprofile --rerun-incomplete --use-conda --executor slurm`
- For exporting a conda env to a JupyterLab kernel: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=firstEnv`

# Jun 23, 2025

- Potential issues + cause of issues:
  - User was renamed at some point in time and that is screwing up the admin rights and read/write permissions
  - Also wsl may potentially be corrupted but uninstalling wsl would remove all the packages and other data associated with it
- Task for the week while O2 is down: create a workflow for the downstream analysis of the annotated sequences
  - Identify ORIs and IS using built software
    - OriV-Finder, ISEScan, ABRicate
  - Figure out a way to index the features so that only ones that have the correct topology of ORI IS ORI IS can be filtered out
  - Test on the 3 sequences pulled from literature that are confirmed to have the specific sequence we are looking for.
  - Make this into a snakefile
- Test batch 3 seqs from the papers
  - Done finding ORIs and ISes
  - How am I actually going to implement finding the correct pattern?
    - Key features: same IS seen 2+ times, ORI sandwiched between any of the same repeating IS


# Jun 24, 2025

- Abricate ‚Üí used to find ORIs (for now)
  - Example usage: abricate --db plasmidfinder fusion-seqs/*.fasta > ORIs.tsv
- Approach to finding the heterodimers of our interest
  - Determine the number of class changes (don‚Äôt want any that have 2 or less)
- Steps:
  - First compile the results into one big .tsv file and do some filtering with pandas
    - Ex: filter out any IS that only show up once
  - Since all the positions exist, can determine the order of the features and look how many ‚Äúclass changes‚Äù occurs for each IS
  - Positive controls: the 3 plasmids from literature, neg control: the monomers from literature
- Snakefile to do:
  - Run abricate on all files to find ORIs
  - Run ISEScan on all files to find IS and compile all results into one .tsv file
  - Run heterodimer-finder.py script
- Application of project to antibacterial resistance
  - Can run plasmids through AMRfinder and can present a summary finding of there are this many plasmids that gained AMR genes through plasmid dimerization via IS


# Jun 25, 2025

- Finished heterodimer-finder.py
- Working on Snakefile
- ISEScan not working for some reason ‚Üí troubleshoot
- Problem:
  - 2 of 3 positive controls successfully identified, however one failed because none of the IS identified in the paper were identified by ISEScan
  - Fix: BLAST search using ISEFinder database


# Jun 26, 2025

- Generalize heterodimer-finder.py to 2 scenarios:
  - Aggregated file with information about multiple sequences
  - For a single plasmid
- ISEScan not working‚Ä¶ made a new conda env with only ISEScan and this seems to be working
- Snakefile fixed and working
  - 2 ways of finding IS: ISEScan or BLAST search using ISEFinder database
- Problem: one of the negative controls is being picked up as a sequence of interest
  - Not a problem ‚Üí not uncommon to have multiple origins and could be sandwiched between ins seqs by chance
  - Also, we don‚Äôt know for certain this is a negative control. 
- Co-occurrence of ORIs ‚Üí what‚Äôs rare what‚Äôs not
- 2-step BLAST: one of each sequence against the ISFinder database, then the result of each of that (the ones with multiple occurrences) extract the sequence and pairwise BLAST (because there may be subtypes)

To do:
- Annotations with bakta ‚Üí o2
  - Fix Snakefile and start running on a larger set of seqs (maybe 100 or so)
- Pairwise BLAST ‚Üí find subtypes for each IS
  - Output tsv file from initial BLAST has no headers‚Ä¶ this is annoying ‚Üí guide
  - Make tweaks to heterodimer-finder.py to support BLAST output
- Analyze co-occurrence frequency of identified ORIs 
- Install OriVFinder on o2
  - Change Snakefile accordingly


# Jun 27, 2025

Priority List:
- Submit annotation job with 100+ seqs
  - Create a script to parse through all seqs and filter only for complete and circular seqs. Also tsv only contains seqIDs, need to somehow obtain the associated fasta file.
  - Can obtain fasta file by appending .fasta to the end of the seqID and downloading the databases
  - Combine all the files from the databases into one directory and make sure they all have the same extension
  - Tweak Snakefile to read in seqs from txt file and test batch on SLURM with 100+ seqs
- Install OriVFinder on o2

To do:
- Testing 15 files right now, if successful launch job with 100 files and let it run over the weekend. 


# Jun 28, 2025

- 1000 worked successfully. Running with all ~75,000 however am missing some input seqs:
  - mMGEs_DRR003613_141_31316_r1256~5754148
  - mMGEs_DRR003613_141_31340_r1256~1018561  
  - mMGEs_DRR003614_141_36435_r1256~4396190
  - mMGEs_DRR003616_119_25658_r1256~3570481
  - mMGEs_DRR003616_119_25665_r1256~3570484
  - mMGEs_DRR003622_141_101836_r1256~2120518


# Jun 30, 2025

- mMGE missing file problem is because the directory name doesn't match the input names
- bakta annotations are running --> will take a while to finish running
  - had to increase memory to 24G bc some of the jobs were failing
  - instead of submiting one bakta per job, find a way to submit multiple baktas per job so that the queue doesn't get clogged up like today (the higher beings of o2 are pissed off rn ‚òπÔ∏è). 

TODO:
- Run initial screen using abricate and ISEScan to get a preliminary dataset
  - Fix Snakefile to deal with the scenario in which ISEScan doesn't find any IS and returns no output files (workaround is expanding the directory in rule all)
- Install OriVFinder and update Snakefile accordingly 
  - asked o2 ppl for help, awaiting response
- Script for pairwise BLAST and figuring out which IS are pairs/unique
  - collapse duplicates (take the highest bitscore for seqs with multiple hits at the same location). filter out high e-vals. run pairwise BLAST searches on unique IDs


# Jul 1, 2025

- Heterodimer Problems:
  - BLAST broken... look into this (.blast.tsv files are empty)
  - Figure out how to skip seqs without insertion sequences-- ISEScan returns no output files for these
- Lower priority item: parsing through initial BLAST output, create a script to run pairwise BLASTs

Worklog:
- Ran 1000 bakta jobs, running another 1000 rn that is stuck in the queue
- Fixed heterodimer-finder.py script, running on 100 seqs

TODO:
- Keep running bakta jobs + keep running heterodimer-finder.py
- Start working on BLAST script while jobs are running tomorrow.
- How to look for plasmid fusion events --> looking for plasmids comprised of 2 distinct plasmids 
  - Lineage info may already exist, look into this
  - Can also BLAST, depends on how many plasmids get filtered out
- Slack lab person in Norway who studies plasmids


# Jul 2, 2025

- Bakta annotations are halfway done, ran overnight and currently at 35064 
- Out of 1000 seqs passed through heterodimer-finder only 22 have the pattern we are looking for --> although this is using ISEScan

TODO:
- Prelim results from 1000 random seqs:
  - How many have multiple origins and chart of co-occurence of origins
- Harvard geneious license

- Turns out abricate did not do a very good job at finding the origins... wait for OriVFinder to be installed.
  - 22 seqs had the wanted feature, only 46 of the 1000 seqs had 2+ origins... should be around 1/3


# Jul 3, 2025

TODO:
- blast.py and ORI co-occurence table
  - for the ORI co-occurence table need 2 things rn, frequency chart of how often 2 ORIs occur together and a freq chart of how often an ORI appears.
later:
- dual boot ubuntu
- Use Docker to run OriVFinder locally


# Jul 7, 2025

- For blast.py, use the plasmid seq as the db and use each insertion sequence hit as the query. From this filter for percent identity > 90
- 9 failed bakta jobs (PILER-CR error, error code: -11): skipping CRISPR for these ones...
  1. mMGEs_k99_473275_r1256~1033030
  2. COMPASS_KY595967.1
  3. GenBank_CP082893.1
  4. COMPASS_NC_020243.1
  5. PLSDB_NZ_LR890507.1
  6. GenBank_KY000037.1
  7. GenBank_CP081352.1
  8. GenBank_CP066478.1
  9. GenBank_CP053913.1
- Prioritize working on Docker, need preliminary results. If Docker is too much of a hassle, use MOB finder
- Trying to figure out Docker and OriVFinder is taking years off my life... fully crashing outüòµ‚Äçüí´
  - To run OriVFinder: `docker run -it --rm orivfinder-ready bash`
  - To execute command: `python oriVfinder.py --fasta /app/data/input.fasta --output_dir /app/data/output`


# Jul 8, 2025:

- Can run OriVFinder on O2 with some tweaks --> already have bakta annotations so skip that step to save time
- Try running OriVFinder locally using Docker to see what the output looks like
- Integrate BLAST script to Snakefile and run it for all the plasmids (might want to comment out some of the rules)
- Start thinking about final presentation and creating a compelling story.
  - Take a look at the paper Kepler sent.
- Order of business: get Snakefile with BLAST up and running, OriVFinder, have presentation in the back of mind.


# Jul 9, 2025:

- Rewrite blast.py, create a fasta file of all the unique hits as the DB for the BLAST search and query each individual fasta file 
- Check out PlasAnn output and determine which one to use as the ORI finder
- Good test case of insertion seqs: DDBJ_AP017321.1
- Path to OriVFinder on O2: `/n/data1/hms/dbmi/baym/kepler/orivfinder/app`
Progress:
- Running blast.py on snakemake
- Decide on OriVFinder vs PlasAnn for finding ORIs --> once this is decided can fix heterodimer-finder.py and get preliminary data. yay!! (also permitting that there are no issues with the Snakefile)


# Jul 10, 2025:
- Work on OriVFinder for O2
